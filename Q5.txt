Q: If you are to start a software company, name 2 people from your batch whom you will choose as your partner and why?

Ans: If I had to build a software company, Roehit and Sreekar would be the people I would pick.
Roehit is an excellent supervisor in the software industry who has gained valuable expertise in a variety of disciplines through internships. Our relationship was also very strong. Additionally, he has some useful contacts who may be very helpful in securing sponsorship and engaging in negotiations regarding the company's holdup. Together, we worked in a startup once, and that experience taught me a lot about how to lead and overcome obstacles as the business grew.
Sreekar and I communicate frequently on a wide range of technologies that are now in development and that we have both long wished to collaborate on. Although we both ended up getting internships at other businesses after applying for numerous positions together, we continued to exchange our technological expertise.
